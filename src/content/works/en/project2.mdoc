### Process

Our team developed and implemented innovative technological solutions to support the Bible translation process. Through collaboration with mother tongue speakers and technology experts, we created tools that streamline the translation workflow while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy. The project focused on developing user-friendly interfaces and automated quality control systems that empower local translators while ensuring consistency and reliability.

### Outcome

The technological innovations resulted in a 50% reduction in translation time while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy. The new tools have enabled more efficient collaboration between translation teams and improved the overall quality of the translated Scriptures. Most importantly, these technological solutions have made the translation process more accessible to mother tongue speakers, accelerating the pace at which Bibleless languages receive God's Word.
