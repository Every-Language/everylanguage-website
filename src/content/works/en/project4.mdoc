**Case Study:** Language Translation Initiative\
**Organization:** Every Language\
**Location:** Global\
**Website:** [https://everylanguage.org](https://everylanguage.org)

### Process

Our team embarked on a transformative journey to bring the full Bible to a previously Bibleless language group. Through intensive collaboration with mother tongue speakers and local church leaders, we implemented our innovative Oral Mother Tongue (OMT) translation methodology. The process integrated cutting-edge technology with traditional translation techniques, ensuring both accuracy and cultural relevance. Our approach focused on empowering local communities while maintaining the highest standards of biblical translation.

### Outcome

The project achieved remarkable success, completing the full Bible translation in just 18 months - a significant improvement over traditional methods. The implementation of technology as leverage resulted in a 40% increase in translation efficiency. Most importantly, the translated Bible has sparked a discipleship movement within the language community, with local churches actively using the Scriptures for evangelism and discipleship training.
